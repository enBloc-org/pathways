## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is an app that is used to inform local authorities of what t-levels are assigned to-do and what future careers in can align with.The tool is made to integrate with labour market information sources so that users can see job market trends which then allows the user to make informed decisions about education and employment. Local authorities benefit from this integration as it allows them to tailor educational programs to meet the needs of the local job market. On the other hand employers can use the app to identity and recruit talent directly from the pool of students who have completed relevant t-level qualifications.
